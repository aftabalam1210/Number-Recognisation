Introduction
Number Recognition is a Python-based project that uses deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a neural network capable of recognizing handwritten digits. The model is designed to achieve high accuracy and generalization on unseen data.

Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/aftabalam1210/Number-Recognisation.git
Change directory: cd number-recognition
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the number recognition model on your own handwritten digit images, follow these steps:

Prepare your digit images as PNG files.
Ensure that the images are 28x28 pixels and grayscale.
Place the images in the test_images folder.
Run the prediction script: python predict.py
The model will process the images and display the recognized digits along with confidence scores.

Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is the MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

The MNIST dataset is available in the TensorFlow/Keras library, and the project will automatically download and preprocess the data during training.

Model Architecture
The number recognition model is based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, dropout layers to prevent overfitting, and fully connected layers to make predictions.

The exact model architecture and hyperparameters are defined in the model.py file.

Training
To train the model from scratch or fine-tune it, follow these steps:

Ensure the dataset is available and preprocessed.
Modify the hyperparameters and settings in the config.py file if necessary.
Run the training script: python train.py
The training process will be logged, and the trained model will be saved for later use.

Evaluation
During training, the model's performance is evaluated on a separate validation set to monitor its accuracy and loss. After training, the model's final performance is evaluated on a test set that is not seen during training or validation.

Results
Our number recognition model achieves an accuracy of over 98% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing handwritten digits.
